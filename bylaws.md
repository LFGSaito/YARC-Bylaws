be held at any point whenever there is a vacancy within the BoD, within two months. Members of the
organization may apply for a vacant position, and the board will select ten primary candidates from the
applicants. The BoD will have a blind vote and whomever receives the most votes will be offered the position. In
the case the chosen candidate refuses the position, votes will be re-cast for the remaining nine primary
candidates. Once a chosen candidate accepts their position on the BoD , the board will ensure the new BoD
member understands the Constitution and By-Laws. This process will be repeated for all vacancies. There are
no term limits imposed on any elected position. As such, a BoD member shall hold their position unless

diminished. All equipment purchased by the organization itself, from its treasury, remains property of the
organization and likewise, no right of ownership attaches to such by the appointed Trustee (or their successor).

YOUNG AMATEURS RADIO CLUB
Discord Server Rules
Article I. The ‘Young Hams’ discord server will be operated and moderated according to the following rules.
1. No politics: For young people, especially today, politics are very polarizing. Please refrain from
irrelevant politics (relevant politics = those concerning amateur radio).
2. Watch your language: Swearing is okay, but negatively directing it at someone or using it excessively
is not.
3. Watch your manners: Please follow basic etiquette as a member of this server. This includes, but is
not limited to: no spamming, no unnecessary pings, no abusing bot functions, and no being obnoxious
in voice.
4. Mind channel topics: This is not the strictest of rules, just please try to keep conversations where they
should go. For the most part, irrelevant memes should be posted in #memes and try and keep bot
commands in #bot.
5. Keep it clean: Names and memes should be kept inoffensive. No NSFW content or discussion,
including (but not limited to) porn, gore, and nudity. Keep it PG-13.
6. If you see something, say something: If you see something wrong happening in a channel, tag the
mod team to ensure that they see it. (point rule breakers to this channel; if their behavior carries on,
please tag us!)
7. Be inclusive: This is the Discord for young hams, so remaining inclusive to everyone, especially new
hams, is crucial. No arguing about what is considered non-inclusive. LGBTphobia of any kind is not
allowed.
8. No trolling: Trolling, shit-stirring, and provoking people are all forms of nonsense that need not take
place in this server.
9. Nicknames: No name-spamming, no offensive nicks, no sexually explicit nicks. This also applies to
profile pictures.
10. No Hacking: Really? Do I need to explain? Dammit Scotty.
11. Loopholes: Exploitation of any loopholes found in the rules will result in a swift update to the rules
list, and likely mod action toward the exploiter. Please report any loopholes you may find.
12. BOARD HAS FINAL SAY: The board of YARC reserves the final right in any and all moderation
decisions. Reasonable appeals will be taken into consideration.
Article II. Moderation rules.
1. All moderation must be impartial to personal relationships with the offending party.
2. Messages should not be deleted on ban unless they are explicit or non inclusive in nature.
3. Repeat warnings (3) are to result in a temp-ban lasting 24 hours.
4. After the first temp-ban, continued rule-breaking will result in a permanent ban.
5. Ban-evasion will result in an immediate ban.
6. The YARC Board reserves the final right in any and all moderation decisions.
